                                    <p>Education is an art of life which makes our life easy and better. We can also term education as another form of knowledge. A child is born ignorant but he learns various skills and techniques, all are various types of education.<br></br>

Evidence of education in India can be seen from the Vedic period. In Hinduism, children use to start their education from the age of 5, whereas in Buddhism it was 8 years. It is an education that inspires us well and helps us to brighten our future.<br></br>
